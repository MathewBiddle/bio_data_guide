# Preface {-}

This book contains a collection of examples and resources related to mobilizing marine biological data to the
[Darwin Core standard](https://dwc.tdwg.org/) for sharing though [OBIS](https://obis.org/). This book has been developed
by the Standardizing Marine Biological Data Working Group (SMBD). The working group is an open community of practitioners,
experts, and scientists looking to learn and educate the community on standardizing and sharing marine biological data.

If you would like to join the SMBD or learn more, checkout this [README](https://github.com/ioos/bio_data_guide/blob/main/README.md).
