## Zooplankton Abundance

- This dataset processed by Dylan Pugh during the 2022 Marine BioData Mobilization Workshop.
- The raw data is pulled from ERDDAP [here](https://www.neracoos.org/erddap/tabledap/WBTS_CFIN_2004_2017.csv).
- The data is structured as an Event-core dataset using the occurrence and mof extensions.
- This data was collected using a mesh-collection method falling under the NERC concept http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/L05/current/22/. 
This concept is listed in the Event file as samplingProtocol, the relevant MoFs (eg mesh size, volume filtered) are then linked to the events.

This example has also been documented as an MBON use-case for IOOS [here](https://ioos.github.io/mbon-docs/use-case.html#sending-data-to-obis-usa)
